## Notifications
## The default is to send email on all failures and changed success
## Adding other notifiers (like IRC) does not disable the email one
notifications:
  ## If this gets annoying, remove the email section
  ## or change always to changed in on_success
  email:
    on_success: always
    on_failure: always
  ## Are we going to want this on or off?
  irc:
    # TMW irc doesn't work for some reason; freenode does ...
    # I'm leaving it like this because it's what I'd like to use.

## Commands before installing prerequisites

# before_install: git submodule update --init --recursive

## Install prerequisites
install:

### The rest of the file creates a build matrix
### containing gcc-4.4 through gcc-4.7 and clang-3.1

## This doesn't work - travis defaults to plain gcc if unknown
# compiler: gcc-4.4
# compiler: gcc-4.5
# compiler: gcc-4.6
# compiler: gcc-4.7
# compiler: clang

## Environment variables to expand the build matrix
## Needed because compiler: gcc overwrites CC and CXX
env:
  - REAL_CC=gcc-4.4 REAL_CXX=g++-4.4
  - REAL_CC=gcc-4.5 REAL_CXX=g++-4.5
  - REAL_CC=gcc-4.6 REAL_CXX=g++-4.6
  - REAL_CC=gcc-4.7 REAL_CXX=g++-4.7
  - REAL_CC=clang   REAL_CXX=clang++
